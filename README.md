Welcome to Probot on Glitch
=========================

This is the Glitch equivalent of running `create-probot-app` to generate a new probot app locally. Updates to your code will instantly deploy and update live.

## Getting Started

To get your own Glitch-hosted Probot up-and-running, follow these steps. If you need more detail, the [Probot Docs](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configuring-a-github-app) are a great place to go to learn more.

1. [Configure a new app on Github](https://github.com/settings/apps/new).
    - Hit the "Show" button on the top left of this page to find the URL. It will look something like `https://random-word.glitch.me/probot`, except the domain will be specific to your app.
    - For the Webhook URL, use this URL (again, updating the domain to match yours): `https://random-word.glitch.me/`. Notice that we left off the `/probot`.
    - For the Webhook Secret, just use "development".
    until Step 4.
    - Save your changes.
    - On the **Permissions & webhooks** tab, add read and write permissions for issues.
    - On the **Permissions & webhooks** tab, subscribe to **Issues** events.
    - Save your changes.
    - On the configuration page that comes up after saving, download your private key. It will be saved into a file named `my-app-name.2018-06-20.private-key.pem`, with your app name, and today's date.

2. Click the **Install** tab, and install your app into one of your repositories.

3. Click the **New File** button (at left) and type `.data/private-key.pem`. Then click **Add File**. Open a terminal, and from your download folder run `cat my-app-name.2018-06-20.private-key.pem | pbcopy` (except using your app's name and today's date). In the new file in Glitch, paste the contents of the clipboard.

4. Edit the `.env` file (at left) with your app credentials. 
    - `APP_ID` can be found in the About section of your Github app.
    - `WEBHOOK_SECRET` is the value you generated in Step 2.
    - `PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=` should be set to `.data/private-key.pem`. 
    - `NODE_ENV=` should be set to `production`. 

5. Wait for app to load. A green `Live` label should show up next to the **Show** button when it's finished loading.

6. Open a new issue in the repo where you installed your app, and watch for your app to reply!

5. Head back to our [Webhook Docs](https://probot.github.io/docs/webhooks/) to learn how to start building your app.
